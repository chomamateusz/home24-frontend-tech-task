# NOTES

- I'm quite new to TypeScript
- I do not used emotion before, mostly I've beed using Material-UI custom styling solution
- instead of axios fetch could be used, but axios is more handy and rejects on not successful HTTP statuses

## Problems I can't solve

- loading right category from API without api docs
- same thing with pagination
- articles and categories from API do not have unique id so I can't be sure to uniques of key prop
- route for single product and add to cart and search functionality

## What else can be done

I do not attempt to do this points below because of my understanding of "Your task is (...) to improve it by refactoring the code". Refactor should not change design or functionality, so I focused on the existing code. If I get it wrong, please let me know.

- RWD/breakpoints/media queries should be added
- modern and fresh design should be added
- animated loaders should be added
