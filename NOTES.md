# NOTES

- I'm quite new to TypeScript
- I do not used emotion before, mostly I've beed using Material-UI custom styling solution
- instead of axios fetch could be used, but axios is more handy and rejects on not successful HTTP statuses

## Problems I can't solve

- loading right category from API without api docs
- articles and categories from API do not have unique id so I can't be sure to uniques of key prop
